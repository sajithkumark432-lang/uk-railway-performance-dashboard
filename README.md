## 🔍 Executive Key Insights
- Standard Class drives the majority of total revenue, driven by significantly higher passenger volume, while First Class contributes premium revenue at lower volume, indicating an opportunity for targeted upsell strategies.

- Advance and Anytime tickets dominate peak travel periods, particularly during morning and evening hours, suggesting strong commuter demand and limited price sensitivity during these time windows.

- Service reliability remains high, with the majority of journeys operating on time; however, delays still represent a meaningful operational risk that directly impacts customer satisfaction.

- Staffing-related issues are the leading cause of delays, exceeding weather and traffic factors, highlighting a clear opportunity for operational planning and workforce optimization.

- High-traffic routes and major departure stations account for a disproportionate share of total journeys, indicating where capacity expansion, timetable optimization, and service improvements would deliver the highest impact.

- Peak-hour congestion aligns with increased delay frequency, reinforcing the need for targeted interventions during high-demand periods rather than broad, system-wide changes.

#### Overall, the analysis identifies clear opportunities to improve operational efficiency, optimize pricing strategies, and enhance passenger experience by focusing on peak-hour demand, staffing optimization, and high-volume routes.
